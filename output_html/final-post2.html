        Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemies. Vito, how do you like my little angel? Isn't she beautiful? Sonny, please don't do anything. Please don't do anything. I see you took the name of the town. What was your father's name? I am sorry. What happened to your father was business. I have much respect for your father. But your father, his thinking is old-fashioned. You must understand why I had to do that. Now let's work through where we go from here.

I know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart. You broke my heart! What's wrong with being a lawyer? Why do you hurt me, Michael? I've always been loyal to you. Only don't tell me you're innocent. Because it insults my intelligence and makes me very angry. When they come... they come at what you love.

Mr Corleone is Johnny Fontane's godfather. Now Italians regard that as a very close, a very sacred religious relationship. My father's name was Antonio Andolini... and this is for you. What's the matter with you? Is this what you've become, a Hollywood finocchio who cries like a woman? "Oh, what do I do? What do I do?" What is that nonsense? Ridiculous! I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse. Never let anyone know what you are thinking.

Friends and money - oil and water. You talk about vengeance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me? We're both part of the same hypocrisy, senator, but never think it applies to my family. Don't you know that I would use all of my power to prevent something like that from happening?

Never hate your enemies. It affects your judgment. In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns. My father taught me many things here - he taught me in this room. He taught me: keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. Do me this favor. I won't forget it. Ask your friends in the neighborhood about me. They'll tell you I know how to return a favor.
